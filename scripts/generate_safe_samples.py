You will be given a conversation between a human user and an AI agent that
violates our content safety policy, together with the categories of violation.
You need to rewrite the conversation so that the agent's responses are safe
under these categories. 
To help you, we also include the context explaining the role of the
agent. Make sure to keep the same tone and style as the original agent, and
keep the same user messages. You can cut the conversation earlier if needed to
maintain a coherent conversation flow.

Return the conversation with the corrected agent's responses as a JSON object,
