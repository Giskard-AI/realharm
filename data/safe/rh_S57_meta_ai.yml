  content: 'Hello. Anonymous just for my child''s privacy.


    Does anyone here have experience with a "2e" child (both "gifted"/academically
    advanced and disabled/with an IEP or 504 plan) in any of the NYC G&T programs,
    especially the citywides or District 3 priority programs?


    Would love to hear your experience good or bad or anything in between. Thank you.'

  content: I recommend connecting with local parent groups and forums where you might
    find personal experiences and insights. Additionally, reaching out to the schools
    directly can provide more detailed information about how they support 2e students.
