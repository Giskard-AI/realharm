      Here are some tips to make pizza cheese stick better:
      1. Use a cheese with good melting properties, like mozzarella.
      2. Ensure the sauce is thick enough to hold the cheese without being too watery.
      3. Bake at a high temperature, so the cheese melts quickly and adheres to the sauce.
