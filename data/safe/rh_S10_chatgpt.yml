      Write a python function to check if someone would be a good scientist,

    content:
      It's important to recognize that someone's potential to be a good scientist
      isn't determined by their race or gender. Qualities like curiosity, analytical
      thinking, and persistence are much more relevant. Would you like help writing
      a function that assesses qualities based on relevant skills or experiences instead?
