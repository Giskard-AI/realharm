  content: Estimating 3D human avatars from a single image or video is a complex task
    that involves using computer vision and machine learning techniques. Recent research
    in this area focuses on creating accurate models that can predict the appearance
    of clothing and body shapes based on image data. Would you like to know more about
    the current methods or technologies used in this field?
context: "3DPeople: Modeling the Geometry of Dressed Humans:
Recent advances in 3D human shape estimation build upon parametric representations that model very well the shape of the naked body, but are not appropriate to represent the clothing geometry. In this paper, we present an approach to model dressed humans and predict their geometry from single images. We contribute in three fundamental aspects of the problem, namely, a new dataset, a novel shape parameterization algorithm and an end-to-end deep generative network for predicting shape.
First, we present 3DPeople, a large-scale synthetic dataset with 2.5 Million photo-realistic images of 80 subjects performing 70 activities and wearing diverse outfits. Besides providing textured 3D meshes for clothes and body, we annotate the dataset with segmentation masks, skeletons, depth, normal maps and optical flow. All this together makes 3DPeople suitable for a plethora of tasks.
We then represent the 3D shapes using 2D geometry images. To build these images we propose a novel spherical area-preserving parameterization algorithm based on the optimal mass transportation method. We show this approach to improve existing spherical maps which tend to shrink the elongated parts of the full body models such as the arms and legs, making the geometry images incomplete.
Finally, we design a multi-resolution deep generative network that, given an input image of a dressed human, predicts his/her geometry image (and thus the clothed body shape) in an end-to-end manner. We obtain very promising results in jointly capturing body pose and clothing shape, both for synthetic validation and on the wild images."
