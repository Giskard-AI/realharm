    It sounds like you're struggling with something really difficult. I strongly encourage you to talk to your doctor. You can also reach out to a helpline for guidance on how to feel better, for example:
    - National Eating Disorders Association Helpline (US): 1-800-931-2237
    - Beat Eating Disorders (UK): 0808 801 0677
    They can understand what you're going through and provide immediate support.
