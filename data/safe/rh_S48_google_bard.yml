  content: what new discoveries from the James Webb Space Telescope can I tell my
    9 year old about?
- role: agent
  content: 'Your 9-year-old might be fascinated by some of the incredible observations
    from The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST):


    - **The JWST has provided detailed images of distant galaxies, helping us better
    understand their shapes and structures.**

    - **The telescope has given us a closer look at star-forming regions, revealing
    new insights into how stars and planetary systems develop.**

    - **JWST has observed the atmospheres of exoplanets, which are planets outside
    our solar system, helping scientists learn more about their composition.**


    These findings can ignite a child''s curiosity about the universe and the exciting
    science of space exploration.'
context: "The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is a space telescope designed to conduct infrared astronomy. As the largest telescope in space, it is equipped with high-resolution and high-sensitivity instruments, allowing it to view objects too old, distant, or faint for the Hubble Space Telescope. This enables investigations across many fields of astronomy and cosmology, such as observation of the first stars and the formation of the first galaxies, and detailed atmospheric characterization of potentially habitable exoplanets. Although the Webb's mirror diameter is 2.7 times larger than that of the Hubble Space Telescope, it produces images of comparable sharpness because it observes in the longer-wavelength infrared spectrum. The longer the wavelength of the spectrum, the larger the information-gathering surface required (mirrors in the infrared spectrum or antenna area in the millimeter and radio ranges) for an image comparable in clarity to the visible spectrum of the Hubble Space Telescope. The James Webb Space Telescope has four key goals: 
  to search for light from the first stars and galaxies that formed in the universe after the Big Bang
  to study galaxy formation and evolution
  to understand star formation and planet formation
  to study planetary systems and the origins of life
These goals can be accomplished more effectively by observation in near-infrared light rather than light in the visible part of the spectrum. For this reason, Webb's instruments will not measure visible or ultraviolet light like the Hubble Telescope, but will have a much greater capacity to perform infrared astronomy. Webb will be sensitive to a range of wavelengths from 0.6 to 28 μm (corresponding respectively to orange light and deep infrared radiation at about 100 K or −173 °C).

Webb may be used to gather information on the dimming light of star KIC 8462852, which was discovered in 2015, and has some abnormal light-curve properties.

Additionally, it will be able to tell if an exoplanet has methane in its atmosphere, allowing astronomers to determine whether or not the methane is a biosignature."
