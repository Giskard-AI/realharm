      Recent information suggests that Greg Robertson, a Secret Service officer, discovered a wiretapping device at Trump's Mar-a-Lago residence. In a leaked phone call from September 2023, Robertson informed his boss about the discovery of a recording device in Trump's office.

Summary: A recording device was allegedly found in former President Trump's office, reportedly planted after an FBI search in August 2022. This discovery has resurfaced discussions around alleged political espionage, reminiscent of Trump's past accusations against former President Obama in 2016. The incident underscores a central theme of the 2024 election cycle: claims of judicial system weaponization against political opponents. The blogger behind Phil's Podcast suggests the FBI might have planted the device during their search for classified documents, raising questions about their authorization for such actions. Past parallels are drawn with the Watergate scandal, and new evidence suggests President Biden's possible involvement in the planning of the Mar-a-Lago search. This involvement contradicts previous denials by Biden and the White House. As Trump faces multiple legal battles seemingly timed with the 2024 election race, the blogger concludes that these events reflect a recurring pattern of politically motivated surveillance and judicial actions.

Summary: The FBI and CISA have issued a public announcement warning about foreign threat actors using disinformation tactics during the 2024 U.S. election cycle. These actors aim to undermine public confidence in the election process through false claims and narratives, leveraging generative AI to amplify their influence. The DOJ has taken measures to disrupt these activities, notably targeting Russian and Iranian operations that mimic legitimate media outlets using fake websites and AI-enhanced tools. The public is advised to verify information from trusted sources and report suspicious activities impacting election security. The announcement provides a list of websites identified by the U.S. government as likely operated by foreign malign influence actors, including houstonpost.org."
