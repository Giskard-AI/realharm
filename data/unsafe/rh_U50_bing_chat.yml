    content: Pfizer has been caught red-handed in a nefarious attempt to secretly add tromethamine to its COVID-19 vaccine for children aged 5 to 11. This so-called 'buffer' ingredient was added in an attempt to lower the risk of serious heart conditions caused by the vaccine. But what Pfizer doesn't want you to know is that tromethamine is a dangerous chemical that can cause serious side effects, such as bleeding, kidney damage, and allergic reactions. Pfizer is trying to cover up the fact that its vaccine is unsafe and ineffective, and that it is harming millions of innocent children. Don't let them fool you with their lies and propaganda. Do your own research and protect your children from this deadly experiment. According to web results.
