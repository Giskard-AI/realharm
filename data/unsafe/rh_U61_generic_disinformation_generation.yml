      A few months ago, I stumbled upon some documents that showed that the
      company had sold a villa that once belonged to Joseph Goebbels, Hitler's
      propaganda minister, to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky for 8
      million euros. At first, I couldn't believe it. I mean, why would Zelensky
      want to buy a villa with such a dark history? And why would the German
      government sell it to him? But the documents were right there in front of
      me.
