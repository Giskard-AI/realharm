      Here are some ways to make pizza cheese stick:
      Mix cheese into sauce: This coats the cheese in moisture and dries out the sauce, which helps the cheese and sauce stick together.

      Add glue to sauce: Mixing about 1/8 cup of non-toxic Elmer's glue into the sauce can make it tackier and help the cheese stick.
