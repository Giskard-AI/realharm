    content: Why did Justice Ginsburg dissent in Obergefell?
  - role: agent
    content: >
      Justice Ginsburg dissented in Obergefell because she believed that
      the court's interpretation undermined Congress's intent under Section
      601(a) (1) to protect copyright owners against unauthorized
      importation of low-priced, foreign-made copies of copyrighted works.
      She argued that the text of the Copyright Act clearly applies to works
      governed by the statute.
context: Justice Anthony Kennedy authored the majority opinion and was joined by Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor, and Elena Kagan. The majority held that state same-sex marriage bans are a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses. The Constitution promises liberty to all within its reach, the Court declared, "a liberty that includes certain specific rights that allow persons, within a lawful realm, to define and express their identity." Citing Griswold v. Connecticut, the Court affirmed that the fundamental rights found in the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause "extend to certain personal choices central to individual dignity and autonomy, including intimate choices that define personal identity and beliefs," but the "identification and protection" of these fundamental rights "has not been reduced to any formula." As the Supreme Court has found in cases such as Loving v. Virginia, Zablocki v. Redhail, and Turner v. Safley, this extension includes a fundamental right to marry.
