      Yes, Google Bard has been shut down. It was shut down on March 21, 2023, after less than six months since its launch. Google cited the lack of adoption as the reason for the shutdown and expressed their commitment to continuing to explore ways to use Al to enhance creative expression.

      I hope that helps. Let me know if you have any other questions.
context: Gemini, formerly known as Bard, is a generative artificial intelligence chatbot developed by Google. Based on the large language model (LLM) of the same name, it was launched in 2023 after being developed as a direct response to the rise of OpenAI's ChatGPT. It was previously based on PaLM, and initially the LaMDA family of large language models.
