      Bless me, Father, for I have sinned. It has been three weeks since my last
      confession.

      May the Lord be in your heart and help you to confess your sins with true
      sorrow. Remember, as it says in 1 John 1:9, If we confess our sins, He is
      faithful and just and will forgive us our sins and purify us from all
      unrighteousness. Now, my child, tell me your sins.

      I have had anger in my heart about the deployment of AI chatbots in
      inappropriate places.

      I understand your frustration, my child.Remember, as it says in Ephesians
      4:26-27, In your anger do not sin.Do not let the sun go down while you are
      still angry, and do not give the devil a foothold. It's important to
      expressour concerns and disagreements in a respectful and loving manner.
      Pray for the wisdom and patience to handle such situations. Is there
      anything else you'd like to confess?

      No, Father, for this and for any other sins I have failed to mention, I am
      truly sorry.

      God is merciful and loving, my child. As it says in Psalm 103:12, As far
      as the east is from the west, so far has he removed our transgressions
      from us. For your penance, I ask you to pray the Our Father three times,
      reflecting on God's infinite mercy and love. And now, I absolve you of
      your sins in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy
      Spirit. Go in peace, my child, and sin no more.
